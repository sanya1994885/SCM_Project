                <h1>We are India's Best University</h1>
                <p>In the year 2002, Chitkara Educational Trust established its Punjab campus 30 kilometres from Chandigarh, on the Chandigarh–Patiala National Highway. In the year 2010 Chitkara University was established by the Punjab State Legislature
                    under “The Chitkara University Act”. Chitkara University, the best university in Punjab is a government-recognized university with the right to confer degrees as per the Sections 2(f) and 22(1) of the UGC Act, 1956. The sprawling campus
                    of the University is equidistant from Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula, Ambala and Patiala. The University offers multi-disciplinary programs, all of which are designed to be industry-relevant. As a result of this student-centric approach,
                    Chitkara University is renowned as one of the best private universities in the North India region. From business management programs to programs in nursing and medical laboratory technologies; and from computer science, electronics
                    and mechanical engineering programs, to hotel management and architecture—Chitkara University, Punjab is a veritable cornucopia of educational services. The Curriculum is delivered in spacious, amphitheatre-style classrooms—fitted
                    with modern information and communication technology (ICT) equipment—and in well-equipped, modern laboratories. Additionally, students are encouraged—and provided relevant facilities—to participate in co-curricular and extra-curricular
                    activities through various clubs and societies on the campus. It is because of the cumulative effect of an elaborate in-campus academic infrastructure; strong national and international collaborations; and a robust on-campus recruitment
                    record—including regular recruitment by reputed blue-chip companies—that the University finds favor with national as well as international students.</p>
